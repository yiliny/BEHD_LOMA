\ssc{Possible modification}

Here we consider the following approaches for the sake of better numerical practices
\begin{itemize}
  \item Solve Langevin equation numerically or solve Fokker-Planck equation directly;
  \item Add second derivatives or not; ($b_4 = b_5 = c_4 = c_5 = 0$)
  \item Ignore rotation and fix $\Theta = 0$
  \item Modify Gaussian random force with "Heaviside" function or not; to avoid sudden collapse $z<0$
  \item How to determine the initial $z$ value near the equilibrium position;
  \item Add Coulomb interaction or not; ($\frac{Q^2}{4\pi\veps z} \exp(-\lambda_D/z)$)
  \item Diagonalize M matrix or not? physical meaning?
  \item Consider $\kappa$ correction to which order?
\end{itemize}
